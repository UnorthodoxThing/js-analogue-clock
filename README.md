## What was learned:

* Use the constructor function `Date()`, and its prototypes `.getSeconds()`, `.getMinutes`, `.getHours`.
* Use basic geometry for angles mixed with clock functions.
* Use asynchronous method to see clock moving.
* Use and create images that will align in one div container.
  -All images were made with the same dimensions and saved as _SVG_ files.
